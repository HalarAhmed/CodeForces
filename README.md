# CodeForces

This repo is where I’m uploading my solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). I use this as a way to track my progress, revisit older problems, and keep things organized.

All problems are solved in **C++**, and I try to keep the code clean and readable. I’ve added comments to some of the tricky ones when needed.


### Why this repo?

- Personal archive of solved problems
- Easy to look back and review
- Helpful for anyone looking for reference solutions

I’m not claiming these are the best or most optimized solutions — just what worked for me at the time.


## How to Use

Feel free to go through the code, use it for reference, or fork the repo if you're building your own archive.
